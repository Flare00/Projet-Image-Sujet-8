# Safe-Eye : CNN Visual Safety Rating of Obfuscated Images
This project aims to offer a program capable of anonymizing the sensitive elements of an image according to various image obfuscation processes (pixelating, blurring, masking, etc).  
A measure of security and a measure of the quality of the image can thus be offered to the user.  
This is a university project on which the students will be graded.
